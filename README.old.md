snowShelves

My app, snowShelves, is a simple inventory application that makes the employers inventory needs easily met with rental equipment.

For the sake of our Monday due date I only got Skis and Snowboards functioning on the app, but it could easily include boots, poles, etc. 
I used routing to give the user a page for each ski and snowboard individually, as well as a home page, with all equipment listed. 

I was able to keep one back end controller file with the basic routes necessary for the app and the applied routes, by just adding a /ski and /snowboard .get to the controller.

In the near future I want to add some more styling to the app. I am currently looking into Bootstrap as an option for refactoring the app to a more aesthetically pleasing application. I decided to use this project to try and cement my beginner knowledge of React and its application, as opposed to obsessing over styling. 
I also would like to implement a user login feature, since that is something an app like this should have. 

The functionality of my app, while basic, is something i think other applications of its ilk could learn from. Over complicating a sorting tool is precisely the thing that makes employees hate these sort of apps.
